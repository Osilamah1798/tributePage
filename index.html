				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p>
				☛ Ken Saro-Wiwa (1941-1995) was a Nigerian writer, environmental activist, and television producer.<br><br>
				☛ He was born in Bori, in the Ogoni region of Nigeria, which would later become a focal point of his activism.<br><br>
				☛ Saro-Wiwa was the author of several novels, plays, and essays, including "Sozaboy" and "On a Darkling Plain."<br><br>
				☛ He co-founded the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) in 1990 to advocate for the rights of the Ogoni people and protest against environmental degradation caused by oil exploration in the Niger Delta.
				<br><br> ☛ Saro-Wiwa led nonviolent campaigns against multinational oil companies, particularly Shell, accusing them of exploiting the resources of the Ogoni region without benefiting the local communities. 
				<br><br> ☛ He was arrested multiple times for his activism and faced harassment and intimidation from the Nigerian government and security forces.
				<br><br> ☛ In 1995, Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders were arrested and falsely accused of involvement in the murder of four Ogoni chiefs. Despite international outcry and calls for his release, he was sentenced to death in a controversial trial widely criticized as unfair and politically motivated.
				<br><br> ☛ On November 10, 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa and his fellow activists were executed by hanging by the Nigerian military dictatorship.
				<br><br> ☛ His execution sparked global condemnation and led to Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations.
				<br><br> ☛ Saro-Wiwa's legacy as a courageous advocate for human rights, environmental justice, and indigenous rights continues to inspire activists around the world.
